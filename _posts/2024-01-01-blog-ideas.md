# The plan

I want to have a blog with a header and footer and left sidebar and content in the middle.
I want the content to be written out like a newspaper columns.
The font should be like old newspaper letters. A traditional feel.
An animation that writes the article out.
Perhaps a transform that makes the letters look like printed on an open book.
