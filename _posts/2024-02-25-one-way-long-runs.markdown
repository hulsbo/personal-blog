# One-way long runs

## Always the wind in my back
The wind can often be disturbingly strong here on the west-coast. A good solution is to plan the run with respect to wind direction so it's always in the back. This method also allows for choosing the best routes from a recreational perspective.

I document here some different options I have for different wind directions with starting point Kvillebäcken:

- **Northen winds:** I run through town down to Slottsskogen or further down to Änggårdsbergens nature reserve.
- **Southern winds:** I run north up to Kungälv. This I did first time 2024-02-24. Bus X4 takes me back home again departing as often as every 10 min (until 18:00, then every 15 min)
- **Western winds:** I run to Skatås training facility or Delsjön's nature reserve. Several good options from there:
  - Tram 5 takes me back from Welandergatan (Skatås) (every 12 min).
  - Bus 17 takes me back from Spåntorget (every 10 min).
  - SVART takes me back from Sävedalen (every 15 min).
- **Eastern winds:** I run through the southern districts of Hisingen and then continue as far as Lilla Varholmen in Torslanda. There bus RÖD departuring every 15 min (until 18:00, then every 30 min) takes me back home again (after changing to X2 at Stenpiren).
- **South-eastern winds:** I run to Björlands Kile via Björlandavägen taking bus 22 back again. Need to make sure I get there before 13:29 when the last expressbus leaves.
- **North-western winds:** As for western winds, or if one wishes a more fine-tuned option simply do opposite direction for the south-eastern winds direction beginning the training with a bus ride.
