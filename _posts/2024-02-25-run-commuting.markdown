Encouraged by this week's advancements in running with a backpack, I have decided to revise the schedule so it allows for (but does not require) commute runs.

## Benefits
The benefits of run commuting over bicycling commuting are several:
- Increased training volume per week
- Benefits a good Level 1-3 / Level 4-5 training ratio (at least 0.8)
- Saves time in the evenings as training has already been done
- Morning commute runs energizes
- Simpler logistics than bicycle commuting (less gear)
- Cheaper
- More fun
- Safer since travelling is done at reduced speeds

There's also risk of overtraining, but if I ease into it by going one-way as a start I can stay flexible and let my body adapt. More about that below.

## Adaptation plan
For commuting, the long term goal is to run both to and from work, which is at a 12 km distance (from where I live today). This adjustment requires great patience while attending to what my body says about it all. I must at all times not overtrain. 

I have however found a good way to ease into it. I simply begin the day with a morning run, getting all energized and ready for the day, and when the day is over I take the bus back home. This I do during a transition period. As my body starts to adapt I increase the training load by adding more and more trips to and back from work into the schedule. 

As I have already been running twice a week for some time now, it would suffice to begin with adding one extra run so that I will have 4 running commute days a week and one bicycle commute there and back again. This I will do for five weeks before increasing the load further, as Jack Daniels do recommend in his book Daniel's Running Formula (2022).
