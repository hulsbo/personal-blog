The purpose of the so called 'threshold training' a runner is doing is to push the body to improve the pace at maximum aerobic function by being at the threshold of it's capability. This threshold is best determined using a [lactate test](/lactate-test).

The standard execution of a threshold session is the following: 

- Between 30 and 60 minutes long.
- Composed of interval with short rests in between (1 - 2 min). This reset the lactate levels enabling "nudging" the threshold more efficiently than during a continuous run.
- Length of intervals can vary in relation to rest time and target distance (longer races makes longer intervals).
- Pace should start to be a bit below the aerobic threshold and be lowered as one feels secure about not going past it.

My cousing Johan Håård suggested for me 2 km/10 min intervals including 2 min rest, but also emphasized that one can experiment and change the time, distance or pace as one pleases within the constraints of above rules. The most important thing in the end is that lactate levels remains below 4 mmol while pace is being close to ones threshold.

Pay also attention to stay within intensity zone 2's heart rate range, see table in [Max pulse test and training zones](/max-pulse-and-zones).
