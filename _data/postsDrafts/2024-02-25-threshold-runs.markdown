## Threshold training
The purpose of the so called 'threshold training' a runner is doing is to push the body to improve the pace at maximum aerobic function by being at the threshold of it's capability. This is the run that uses the insights gained from a lactate test.

The standard execution of a threshold session is the following: 

- between 30 and 60 minutes long.
- composed of interval with short rests in between (1 - 2 min) that resets the lactate levels, which is especially important if one runs very close to the threshold. 
- length of intervals can but as a rule of thumb the longer the runner plans to race the longer intervals it should have. 
- Pace should start to be a bit below the aerobic threshold and be lowered as one feels secure about not going past it.

Johan suggested 2 km or 10 min intervals for me but also emphasized that one can experiment and change the time, distance or pace as one pleases within the constraints of above rules. In the end the most important thing is that the length of training remains within 30 - 60 min and that lactate levels remains below 4 mmol and that pace is close to ones threshold.
