  content: "Ran at 5 degrees of incline at 14 km/h until 40 min, paused at 15 min to tie a shoelace however. The change of pace after 40 min was unplanned and due to feeling exhausted. Took a 5 min rest at 10.5 km/h therefore, and felt the same time pain in left side of stomach and also a bit in the chest, but which faded away as exhaustion disappeared. Before breaking I couldn't reach any higher HR than 173 BPM, so I was suprised that I had to stop because of pains. After the 5 min rest pace I got back again to 14 km/h for «finir en beauté»."

Then back again to 8 degrees ans 12 km/h finishing the session like so. Original plan was to decrease incline incrementally finishing the same way as I started, but felt a little complain in my right knee so decided to keep the inlince to the end. As long as the heartrate is the same, I am happy.'
  distance: "18.5 km (but not quite sure since machine resetted asking me to cool down when there were 2 minutes left, and I failed to record the data before then. Watch says 18.89 km but think it's too optimistic regarding that I was doing a lot of incline. )"

Held around 5:00 minute per km with a heart rate of around 130 BPM. Arriving somewhat soaked and cold to the small boat harbour one hour later I entered restaurant 'Pad Thai' to change, dry up and treat myself with well earned lunch. While digesting my 'Pad Thai' (considering the restuarant was called the same I thought this dish should be a safe choice) I considered my options on what to do next. I had still about 45 min left of running, but the rain was intensifying and wind had picked up blowing against the direction of the home journey. Afraid of not being able to keep the heat up, I decided to end the session and return by the last bus instead. Stride rate was at an unaccepteble average of 165 even though I reminded myself at times about not being lazy with it. There's clearly something about outdoor runs that make my stride rate really bad."
  distance: '12.9 km'

  highlight: "These types of long sessions are really nice in that regard that they are good 'MAF training' while being a recreational excursion at the same time. Listening to something interesting is also just great for these long runs. Too bad I had to quit the session earlier this time but I'm eager to redo and develop this further going forward. Next time I should have pace music on supporting a better stride rate."

  content: "I got the idea to 'finish what I started' yesterday by taking the bus back up to Björlanda kile and from there take me home. The wind had turned and the rain was gone so the run was easy and relaxed. Didn't get my watch while hurrying to the bus, but used runkeeper on my phone as a plan B. Took it quite easy throughout the run with an average pace of 4.30 min/km (13,3 km/h) but should have gone a bit slower for long session pace. Listened to my 180 BPM music playlist to keep sure I held the right stride rate. At the end I sprinted down to 3:18 min/km pace just to get a feel for it."
