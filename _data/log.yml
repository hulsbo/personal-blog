  content: "Snowy and cold, long commuting, training cancelled"

- date: "2024-01-16"
  content: "Snowy and cold, commuting replaced with long 65 min session at gym. Got a little stomach pain in the middle so had to slow down. Did 30 min with incline on 6 degrees at 13.5 km/h. Last 4 kilometers mean HR 177."
  distance: "14.4 km"
  highlight: "HR at 179 last 10 minutes didn't feel too discomforting."
  ahr: "165"

- date: "2024-01-17"
  content: "Started training late in the evening. I was also tired from yesterday's session which I realized was too aggressive in relation to the plan. Decided to run at 16 km/h until I hit 179 HR which I did at about 5,5 km. Then I slowed down to 13,5 km/h, then stomach pain, so slowed down again to 12,5 km/h but with 6 degrees of incline."
  distance: "11.5 km"
  highlight: "Persevered despite low heartrate/pain ratio."
  ahr: "169"

- date: "2024-01-18"
  content: "60 min run is not equivalent to 60 min bike commute. Let myself therefore take it easier than on Tuesday, running 45 min at a relaxed tempo. Held 14 km/h with incline 1, then 2, then 3 at about 25 min. Last 3 min with incline on 6 and 13 km/h."
  distance: "10.4 km"
  highlight: "My cadence seem to really be improving! According to my watch I had an average cadence of 179 HR, and I didn't even go at my maximum speed for the 10k this time."
  ahr: "163"
- date: "2024-01-19"
  content: "Took a rest day because no time for training but as well to compensate for Tuesday's overtraining."

- date: "2024-01-20"
  content: "Interval training instead of distance session. First interval: 3 degrees at 13,5 km/h for 10 min. Second interval: 3 degrees at 14 km/h for 6.5 min. Third interval: 3 degrees at 15 km/h."
  distance: "7.7 km"
  ahr: "First and second interval: 165. Third: 170."
  highlight: "During the 5 min pauses I had 3 degrees incline and 10,5 km/h but retained a HR of sub 140. This HR required three weeks ago an incline of 1."
- date: "2024-01-21"
  content: "Held 6 degrees of incline and 10,5 km/h for the whole session except last 10 min after machine reset, then I increased to 9 degrees."
  distance: "18.9 km"
  ahr: 150
  highlight: "New PB in vertical distance (1162 m) covered in one session. Felt far from exhausted afterwards as well."
- date: "2024-01-22"
  content: "45 min run with incline on 3 except last 2,5 min then 4. Speed first at 13 km/h, but after little less than half-time 13,5 km/h."
  distance: "10.0 km"
  ahr: 160
  highlight: "A good experiment on what amount of incline I can endure without compromising speed. Will continue like this to increase workload without risk of injury, I find it an especially good strategy on rest days. It also builds muscle preventing injury in that manner as well."
- date: "2024-01-23"
  content: "30 min indoor biking. Only biked on HR without pretty much any intervals. Was tough to get HR to rise to satisfactory levels. Low HR/pain ratio in other words."
  distance: "N/A"
  ahr: 142
  highlight: "The low HR/pain ratio really proofs that bike commuting is real easy work in comparison to a run, since I can't get HR to rise even on an indoor bike as much as I'd like. It also proofs my body is not a biker's."
