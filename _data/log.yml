  content: "Snowy and cold, long commuting, training cancelled"

- date: "2024-01-16"
  content: "Snowy and cold, commuting replaced with long 65 min session at gym. Got a little stomach pain in the middle so had to slow down. Did 30 min with incline on 6 degrees at 13.5 km/h. Last 4 kilometers mean HR 177."
  distance: "14.4 km"
  highlight: "HR at 179 last 10 minutes didn't feel too discomforting."
  ahr: "165"

- date: "2024-01-17"
  content: "Started training late in the evening. I was also tired from yesterday's session which I realized was too aggressive in relation to the plan. Decided to run at 16 km/h until I hit 179 HR which I did at about 5,5 km. Then I slowed down to 13,5 km/h, then stomach pain, so slowed down again to 12,5 km/h but with 6 degrees of incline."
  distance: "11.5 km"
  highlight: "Persevered despite low heartrate/pain ratio."
  ahr: "169"

- date: "2024-01-18"
  content: "60 min run is not equivalent to 60 min bike commute. Let myself therefore take it easier than on Tuesday, running 45 min at a relaxed tempo. Held 14 km/h with incline 1, then 2, then 3 at about 25 min. Last 3 min with incline on 6 and 13 km/h."
  distance: "10.4 km"
  highlight: "My cadence seem to really be improving! According to my watch I had an average cadence of 179 HR, and I didn't even go at my maximum speed for the 10k this time."
  ahr: "163"
- date: "2024-01-19"
  content: "Took a rest day because no time for training but as well to compensate for Tuesday's overtraining."

- date: "2024-01-20"
  content: "Interval training instead of distance session. First interval: 3 degrees at 13,5 km/h for 10 min. Second interval: 3 degrees at 14 km/h for 6.5 min. Third interval: 3 degrees at 15 km/h."
  distance: "7.7 km"
  ahr: "First and second interval: 165. Third: 170."
  highlight: "During the 5 min pauses I had 3 degrees incline and 10,5 km/h but retained a HR of sub 140. This HR required three weeks ago an incline of 1."
- date: "2024-01-21"
  content: "Held 6 degrees of incline and 10,5 km/h for the whole session except last 10 min after machine reset, then I increased to 9 degrees."
  distance: "18.9 km"
  ahr: 150
  highlight: "New PB in vertical distance (1162 m) covered in one session. Felt far from exhausted afterwards as well."
- date: "2024-01-22"
  content: "45 min run with incline on 3 except last 2,5 min then 4. Speed first at 13 km/h, but after little less than half-time 13,5 km/h."
  distance: "10.0 km"
  ahr: 160
  highlight: "A good experiment on what amount of incline I can endure without compromising speed. Will continue like this to increase workload without risk of injury, I find it an especially good strategy on rest days. It also builds muscle preventing injury in that manner as well."
- date: "2024-01-23"
  content: "30 min indoor biking. Only biked on HR without pretty much any intervals. Was tough to get HR to rise to satisfactory levels. Low HR/pain ratio in other words."
  distance: "N/A"
  ahr: 142
  highlight: "The low HR/pain ratio really proofs that bike commuting is real easy work in comparison to a run, since I can't get HR to rise even on an indoor bike as much as I'd like. It also proofs my body is not a biker's."
- date: "2024-01-24"
  content: "Ran at 5 degrees of incline at 14 km/h until 40 min, paused at 15 min to tie a shoelace however. The change of pace after 40 min was unplanned and due to feeling exhausted. Took a 5 min rest at 10.5 km/h therefore, and felt the same time pain in left side of stomach and also a bit in the chest, but which faded away as exhaustion disappeared. Before breaking I couldn't reach any higher HR than 173 BPM, so I was suprised that I had to stop because of pains. After the 5 min rest pace I got back again to 14 km/h for «finir en beauté»."
  distance: "14.1 km"
  ahr: "164"
  highlight: "Running at 5 degrees of incline at 14 km/h until 40 min was a great feat despite the need for a 5 min rest pace run after that."
- date: "2024-01-25"
  content: "A normal commute to and from my workplace on the other side of the town. One way is 12 km. Nice to be cycling again after a long brake because of snowy and windy conditions last week." 
  distance: N/A
  ahr: N/A
  highlight: "On the way back home I managed to keep ahead of a Foodora moped while going over Hisingsbron (regard the uphill start). That was fun!"
- date: "2024-01-26"
  content: "Constant speed of 14 km/h with increasing inclines. First interval (10 min): 4 degrees, Second interval (7.5 min): 4.5 degrees, Third interval (7.5 min): 6 degrees. Again I find it hard to hit heartrates above 175 BPM, despite increasing the workload. It's like my mind does not know my heart has become stronger. Or is it a sign that my heart is 'tired' and a rest week is needed?"
  distance: "8.3 km"
  ahr: "I1: 157, I2: 162, I3: 170. Total inc. rest periods: 150."
  highlight: "Last interval was a record high kCal burn rate on the treadmill: 1646 kCal / hour."
- date: "2024-01-27"
  content: "Upon arrival at the gym I discovered (as I was rejected entry) that I had missed paying an invoice and was therefore rejected entry. Nothing to do but to run outside instead. To accomplish one hour I took another round in the park. Some parts of the track were unlit and really dark. "
  distance: "14.8 km"
  ahr: "160"
  highlight: "Not happy with my stride rate. Thought it was perhaps due to the darkness - taking small steps felt dangeroes as the uneven ground might make me trip and fall. The 4.15 min / km was just okay pace, but given the circumstances I conclude to be content."

  content: "Nice sunny weather with a wind from the west. Treated myself with a 12 km run to Bertilssons stuga residing in the middle of the nature area of Delsjön. Got myself a lentil soup and then on the top also a cake with coffee. Then back again in the track, really not knowing where to stop, but when I found a bus stop for line 17 arriving in 3 min I thought this must be my finish. I was happy to not worn me out unnecessarly much running on asphalt the last 6 km back home. Had some minor pains already - in that case rolling is better."
  distance: "18.6 km"
  ahr: "145"
  highlight: "Sunny day; meeting smiles; wind in the back; broad tracks in the forest; sun rays bouncing on icy lakes; a cozy coffee hut serving well deserved good stuff. Who could complain."
