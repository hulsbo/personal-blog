Hello there - and welcome to Stride Reborn!

My name is Oskar Huledal and I have a goal this spring of running GÃ¶teborgsvarvet 2024. I am new to running races but I love to train and improve.

This new race goal has made me ambitious in creating a training plan up until the race the 18:th of May.

Goal is to train as much as possible without compromising my health long term, i.e. getting injured.

Being this ambitious, I thought a good thing to do is to make myself accountable towards people who take an interest, by sharing my running plan and its execution via a blog.

Please press the "Read more" link whenever it's available. Then I have written some more than just a small conclusion of the training made that day.

Thanks for checking in.
