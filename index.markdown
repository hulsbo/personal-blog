Hello There! 

This is my training blog for running Göteborgsvarvet. Downunder you may see my training plan until the very date of the race.

I have a goal of becoming the best runner I can be this spring. Now that is a bold decision to make, so I thought a good thing to do is to make myself accountable for it by blogging during the process. 

Please press the "Read more" link whenever it's available. Then I have written some more than just a small conclusion of the training made that day. 

Thanks for checking in. 

Running Regards. //Oskar
