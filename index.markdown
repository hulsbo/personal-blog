Hello there - and welcome to The Incliner!

My name is Oskar Huledal and I have a goal this spring of running GÃ¶teborgsvarvet 2024. I am new to running races but I love to set ambitious goals and write about my progress towards them - hence the existance of this blog.

To make my efforts more deliberate and effective I have created a [running plan](/running-plan.markdown) for all training I intend to do before the race the 18:th of May. I update this plan with daily logs about how my training progresses so make sure to come back again for more content.

Thanks for checking in.
