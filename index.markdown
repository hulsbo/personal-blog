Hello there - and welcome to The Incliner!

My name is Oskar Huledal and I have a goal this spring of running GÃ¶teborgsvarvet 2024. I am new to running races but I love to train and improve.

This new race goal has made me ambitious in creating a training plan up until the race the 18:th of May.

Goal is to train as much as possible without compromising my health long term, i.e. getting injured.

Being this ambitious, I thought a good thing to do is to make myself accountable towards people who take an interest, by sharing my running plan and its execution via this blog.

I recommend heading over to the [Running Plan](/running-plan.markdown). Apart from the plan itself you can there also find all blog posts written so far. I aim to write about learnings and reflections about running in general as I'm progressing with the training and studying the theory.

Thanks for checking in.
